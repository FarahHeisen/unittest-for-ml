# Tips
- It is really necessary to go from one step to another, by baby steps as advocated by this beautiful philosophy of the TDD.
- Red, Green, Refacto: be uncompromising about it.
- Be careful when naming and partitioning functions: for example, for __fill_missing_values__, both numerical and categorical values must be handled: it is therefore a good idea to partition into smaller methods allowing to handle numerical values on the one hand and categorical values on the other hand.
- If the person is blocked we can always give the first test (recipe test).
